    %% Connections
    Student --> Account
    Student --> Core
    Student --> Projects
    Student --> Level400
    
    %% Implicit connections to internal nodes for layout if needed, 
    %% but connecting to subgraph usually links to first node. 
    %% To ensure flow lines are visible to specific tasks:
    Student --> UC1
    Student --> UC3
    Student --> UC6
    Student --> UC16
